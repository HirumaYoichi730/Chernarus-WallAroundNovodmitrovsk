DayZ Chernarus - Wall Around Novodmitrovsk.
I had this idea for a wall around this area since a friend used this area for a base.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 4x Land_Castle_Gate.
2: 3x Bonfire.
3: 2x Land_Castle_Bergfrit.
4: 2x Land_Castle_Stairs.
5: 1x Land_Misc_Well_Pump_Blue.
6: 1x Land_Castle_Wall1_Corner1.
7: 32x Land_Castle_Wall1_20.


So, easiest way to get to Novodmitrovsk is by going by the coast. That is if you have never been on the northern part of Chernarus.
Just following the road till you get to Svetlojarsk. While you are in there, follow the road till you get to the church.
Make sure that you have the church on your right side and take the first right after the church. If you followed the road
you will then see two small buildings for fast food and grocery. One on each side of the road on the right. If you missed the turn
and come across the police station, just turn around and take the left turn between those foodstands. Then just keep driving and over
the railroads sections. You will then get to a small military camp with some tents on the left side of the road. Just keep following the
road and past the railroad bridge. After a while, you will get to a store on the right side. Take the right turn at that store and then you will
be able to see it clearly, if you have not seen the bonfire at the tower first.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/WallAroundNovodmitrovsk.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/WallAroundNovodmitrovsk.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
